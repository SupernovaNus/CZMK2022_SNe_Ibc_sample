The files here provide the details of the Type Ib/c supernova samples used in Chang et al. (2022) [2210.03088].  
  
Each file lists the Ib/c supernovae overlapped with different IceCube phases (IC40, IC59, IC79, IC86-I, IC86-II~VII), in which each column give the following information of supernovae:  
  
1st - Name  
2nd - Maximum brightness time [MJD]  
3rd - Right ascension [rad]  
4th - Declination [rad]  
5th - Redshift  
6th - Luminosity distance [Mpc]  
7th - Type  
8th ~ 17th: - Pre/post-trial p-values (assuming different neutrino emission models)
